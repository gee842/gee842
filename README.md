# 👋 Hey, I'm Ethan!

I'm an **LLM Architect** and **Machine Learning Engineer** who's been building AI systems since before ChatGPT made it cool. I led my own research and production team during the earliest days of LLMs, and I've been shipping agentic workflows, RAG systems, and production-grade inference pipelines ever since.

When I'm not optimizing inference from 27s → 1s or building knowledge graph integrations, you'll find me playing music (self-taught, multiple instruments) or diving deep into psychology research.


## 🧠 What I Do

- **LLM Systems**: RAG, Chain of Thought, agentic workflows, tool usage, self-validation

- **Inference Optimization**: vLLM, exLlama, GPTQ, AWQ, quantization (1900 tok/s on 13B models)

- **Production AI**: Knowledge graphs + LLMs, intent detection, high-throughput deployments

- **Research**: Co-authoring papers on synthetic data generation with autoencoders


## 👤 About Me

- **Languages**: English (Native), Chinese (Professional)

- **Education**: MEng Computer Science — University of Manchester

- **Interests**: Psychology, Music (multi-instrumentalist)

- **Location**: Based in Malaysia 🇲🇾 / Czech Republic 🇨🇿
